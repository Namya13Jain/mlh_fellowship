# Problem Statement
In India, the share of elderly people is more than 10% of the population, and among them also one out of every four elder person is lonely. This is due to the erosion of our traditional values to stay with our old parents. Their children leave them to succeed in their lives, forgetting that their parents need their love, care and support. Due to these reasons, a lot of them suffer from depression and related disorders. Here are some news reports as well:

# Aging Together
Aging Together is an all-in-one solution for seniors looking for companionship, care, and support. With its easy-to-use interface and wide range of features, Aging Together is the perfect app for anyone looking to improve their quality of life and make meaningful connections. It is an innovative and user-friendly app designed to bridge the gap between the elderly and the younger generation.

1. Aging Together offers a wide range of services, including the ability to find a companion who can provide social interaction and emotional support. Whether you're looking for someone to chat with or someone to accompany you on walks, our app makes it easy to find the perfect match.
2. The app also provides access to caretakers on a rental basis, who can step in and provide the kind of care and attention that family members would normally offer. Whether it's help with day-to-day activities like grocery shopping or assistance with medical appointments, Aging Together is there to provide support. We plan on collaborating with companies like Nightingales and Care24, which will be providing us with 100% verified and trained nurses and caregivers for our seniors.
3. Aging Together also offers a unique mentorship program, connecting seniors with college students who can provide guidance and support as they learn new skills. College students can earn certificates of social internships, which will help them stand out when applying for jobs.

# Techstacks Used
Aging Together is built using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. The app is developed using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications. Flutter's rich set of widgets and development tools enabled the team to create a beautiful and responsive UI for the app.
